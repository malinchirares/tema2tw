            <p>I am Malinchi Rares, born on April 10, 2003, in Brăila. My early inclination towards physical activity led me to the world of karate at the age of 7. What began as a curiosity evolved into a profound passion, resulting in my achievement as a multiple-time national karate champion by the age of 13. These victories not only brought immense pride to my life but also solidified my determination to pursue excellence in every endeavor.</p>

            <p>Alongside my athletic pursuits, I have actively participated in projects that contribute to community development. At the age of 18, I undertook a pivotal role as a Promoter of the values and benefits of European Union membership for the youth in Brăila, as part of a project organized by the European Parliament Office in Romania. This unique experience allowed me to contribute to raising awareness about the significance of the European Union and its potential impact on the future of young individuals. In the summer of 2022, I commenced a new academic chapter, gaining admission to the Faculty of Automation and Computers. This decision reflects my profound interest in technology and the eagerness to acquire and refine skills in this ever-evolving field.</p>

            <p>Aside from my academic pursuits, I have actively engaged in competitive sports. During high school at the "Gheorghe Munteanu Murgoci" National College in Brăila, I added another dimension to my life by joining the "Cuza Sport Baschet Brăila" basketball team. This experience, marked by both successes and challenges, has not only honed my competitive spirit but has also instilled in me the necessary balance required for a sports enthusiast's lifestyle. Beyond sports, I have taken on leadership roles, serving as the vice president of the Youth Forum of Romania - Brăila, further deepening my involvement in community activities.</p>
